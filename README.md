# Generations Ago Calculator Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension which Calculates dates, and displace them in "Generations ago"

So often dates in Wikipedia are abstract, especially when they are more than 100 years ago. The purpose of this Chrome extension would be to calculate how many generations ago that was. Optionally if you entered your age, it could calculate in terms of the number of grandparents grandparents' cycles.

This repository is a placeholder, as of April 15th 2021 I have not begun development yet. I will accept any assistance in terms of code pull-requests or funding in order to get this done.
